Section 3.3
-----------
The mean SLA for the 1984–2022 reference period is located at 1267 +/- 84  m a.s.l.,
considering glaciers within all grid cells.
Overall, we observe a rise in glacier SLA over the 39 years of observation (Fig. 5).
A linear regression model, using the yearly mean composite values,
suggests an average rise in SLA of 3.9±0.4 m yr−1 (R2=0.74, p<0.001)
