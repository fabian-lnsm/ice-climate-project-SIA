## Modelling glacier flow 

Simulation of the SIA flow model as part of the course on Ice&Climate at UU. The goal is to approximate the flow line of real-world Arctic glacier. Furthermore, we want to estimate the sensitivity of the glacier mass and response time to realistic changes in the ELA.

## Folder structure

Main script is the SimpleGlacierModel.py in the scripts folder. The main folder contains the project instructions and final report. See figures and movies for output created by the script.
