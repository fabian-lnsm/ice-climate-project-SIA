## Modelling glacier flow 

Simulation of the SIA flow model as part of the course on Ice&Climate at UU. The goal is to approximate the flow line of real-world Arctic glacier. Furthermore, we want to estimate the sensitivity of the glacier mass and response time to realistic changes in the ELA.

## Folder structure

Main script is the SimpleGlacierModel.py in the scripts folder.
See figures and movies for output created by the scripts
